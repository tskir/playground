Briefly, Barseq read counts were used to establish relative frequencies of each strain at each timepoint and converted to estimates of absolute frequencies using OD measurement data. Absolute counts were used to establish growth curves from which fitness parameters were estimated and then normalized to 0-1 scale where 0 corresponds to null controls and 1 corresponds to WT controls. Meanwhile, TileSeq read counts were used to establish relative allele frequencies in each condition. Non-mutagenized control counts were subtracted from counts (as estimates of sequencing error). log ratios of selection over non-selection counts were calculated. The resulting TileSeq fitness values were then rescaled to the distribution of the BarSeq fitness scores. Fitness scores were joined using confidence-weighted averages. Random-Forest base machine learning was used to impute missing values and refine low-confidence measurements, based on intrinsic, structural, and biochemical features.\r\n\r\nSee [**Weile *et al.* 2017**](http://msb.embopress.org/content/13/12/957) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Additional columns:\r\n* exp.score = experimental score from the joint DMS-BarSeq/DMS-TileSeq screens\r\n* exp.sd = standard deviation of the experimental score\r\n* df = degrees of freedom (number of replicates contributing to the experimental score)\r\n* pred.score = machine-learning predicted score","abstractText":"Although we now routinely sequence human genomes, we can confidently identify only a fraction of the sequence variants that have a functional impact.
